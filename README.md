# Programmes in C++
This repository contains C++ programmes from my assignments at the university level courses "Computers and Programming" and "Basic Programming in C++" at Uppsala University and University of Skövde respectively.

## Expense Tracker

This C++ program tracks and manages shared expenses among people. It allows you to record transactions, calculate total costs, and determine how much each person owes or has advanced.

### Key Features

- **Transactions Management**: Use the `Transaktion` class to handle individual transactions, including date, type, amount, and involved persons.
- **Person Management**: Use the `Person` and `PersonLista` classes to track each person’s contributions and debts.
- **Dynamic Memory**: Utilizes dynamic memory allocation with pointers for managing arrays of transactions and persons.
- **File I/O**: Reads transactions from a file and saves them back after processing.
- **Dynamic Arrays**: Implements dynamic resizing of arrays to accommodate varying numbers of transactions and persons.

### Usage

- **Load Transactions**: Import from a file or input manually.
- **Menu Options**: View transactions, calculate totals, and check individual balances.
