# Programmes in C++
C++ programmes from my assignments at the university level courses "Computers and Programming" and "Basic Programming in C++" at Uppsala University and University of Skövde I did in the summer 2024. 

Transactions Management: Use the Transaktion class to handle individual transactions, including date, type, amount, and involved persons.
Person Management: Use the Person and PersonLista classes to track each person’s contributions and debts.
Dynamic Memory: Utilizes dynamic memory allocation with pointers for managing arrays of transactions and persons.
File I/O: Reads transactions from a file and saves them back after processing.
Dynamic Arrays: Implements dynamic resizing of arrays to accommodate varying numbers of transactions and persons.
